      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Stefan Nelson and I am a graduate of Minnesota State University Moorhead with a Computational Mathematics major with minors in Statistics and Astronomy. Throughout my years in higher education, I have used Python, C++, and R extensively for projects in data analysis and undergraduate research in numerical modelling of partial differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While completing my undergraduate degree, I discovered a love for education and national service that brought me to Flagstaff, AZ. Since mid-2018, I have been in roles such as an instructor and administrator at Northern Arizona University. Recently, I have transitioned to being the STEM Education Integrator at Killip Elementary School though Americorps VISTA. I am deeply passionate in applying my skills in technology and mathematics to problems in education, and VISTA has given me an excellent outlet to do so. I have also recently taken on teaching and tutoring roles at Coconino Community College.&lt;/p&gt;
