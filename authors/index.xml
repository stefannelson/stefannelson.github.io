      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an incoming graduate student at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nau.edu&#34;&gt;Northern Arizona University&lt;/a&gt; in Computer Science, formerly from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mnstate.edu&#34;&gt;Minnesota State University Moorhead&lt;/a&gt; with a Computational Mathematics degree with minors in Statistics and Astronomy. Much of my experience lies in higher education, using Python, C++, and R extensively for projects in data analysis and numerical modelling of partial differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While completing my undergraduate degree, I discovered a love for education that brought me to Flagstaff, AZ. Since mid-2018, I have taught at Northern Arizona University, Coconino Community College, and W.F. Killip Elementary School in various capacities. I value the power of STEM in not only creating opportunities for efficiency, security, and evidence-based decision making in education, but also to empower underrepresented communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to connect with you! Please feel free to contact me using any of the avenues off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
